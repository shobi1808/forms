    <em><strong>PROJECTS</strong></em>
    <div>
          <p><b>Flood Monitoring and Early Warning Detection using IoT (Naan Mudhalvan Project)</b><br>
    During my 3rd year, I successfully completed a project on Flood Monitoring and Early Warning Detection as part of the Naan Mudhalvan 
course in collaboration with IBM. The objective of the project was to develop an IoT-based system capable of detecting potential flood scenarios
and providing early warnings to communities in vulnerable areas, such as villages and coastal regions. The system utilized a combination of sensors, including ultrasonic sensors to measure water levels, liquid level sensors for real-time monitoring of water rise, and meteorological data to track weather conditions like rainfall and humidity. These sensors were integrated with an Arduino board, which acted as the central processing unit for collecting and transmitting data.

   <div> <p><b>Project Title: ColloFest – College Event Management System</b><br>
Developed a full-stack web-based application named ColloFest to streamline the management of college events such as symposiums, workshops, cultural festivals, and student competitions. The platform was built using React.js for the frontend to ensure a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface, allowing different user roles—Admin, Student, and Software Admin—to interact efficiently. The backend was implemented using Node.js, which handled server-side logic, API communication, and user authentication. MySQL was used for secure, structured data storage and retrieval, managed via phpMyAdmin. Key features included event creation and approval, student registration, schedule tracking, real-time notifications, and feedback
collection. Custom CSS and Material-UI were utilized for consistent styling and accessibility across devices. The system was tested thoroughly for performance and usability, and incorporated robust security practices such as role-based access control and input validation. ColloFest improved event coordination, reduced administrative overhead, and provided students with a simplified digital platform to engage with college activities. This project reflects strong skills in full-stack development, database integration, modular system architecture, and real-world user experience optimization.
